<h2>Starter Packages</h2>
<p>Here are the starter packages that we currently offer. Each starter
  package is a ZIP file which contains:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A simple already-working entry to use as a starting point</li>
  <li>Tools that allow you to run your bot and watch it play graphically</li>
  <li>Some sample opponents that you can test your bot against</li>
  <li>One hundred randomly generated maps that you can use for testing</li>
</ul>
<p>Since each starter package contains a simple already-working entry, you
  can actually submit the ZIP file on the Upload Your Code page. See the
  <a href="quickstart.php">Five Minute Quickstart Guide</a> to learn how to
  get your name up on the global leaderboard in less than five minutes.</p>
